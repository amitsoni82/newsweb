                <h2>Public Authorities Should Take Best Efforts To Reduce Trees Required To Be Cut For Public Projects
                </h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        <i class="fas fa-user fa-1x"></i> Written By Amit, June 25, 2024
                    </p>
                    <p class="entertainment-category"Education</p>
                </div>
          

                <p>The Supreme Court has directed that every public authority seeking permission to cut trees for public projects must make best efforts to reduce the number of trees which are required to be cut by re-examining the alignment of the public project.
                </p>

            <p> The Court passed this direction in view of the spirit of Article 51A(Fundamental Duties) of the Constitution of India and the right of citizens to a healthy environment.
            </p>

        <P>A bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih made this direction while hearing an application in the MC Mehta case where the Court is dealing with the environmental issues of Delhi-NCR.
        </P>

        <P>During the proceedings, the Court also told the Uttar Pradesh government that it will grant permission to cut trees for the Agra-Jalesar-Etah road project only after the re-planting process has commenced.
        </P>
                <p> 
                    A bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Augustine George Masih noted that the State of Uttar Pradesh had sought permission to fell 3,874 trees in the Taj Trapezium Zone for the Agra-Jalesar-Etah road project, while the Centrally Empowered Committee's (CEC) report indicated that only 2,818 trees were actually required for removal.
     </p>

               <p>The Court stated that before it considers granting permission for tree felling, the UP government must commence planting 38,740 trees as suggested by the CEC.
            </p>

            <p>Justice Oka further emphasized the Court's intent to enforce stricter conditions for tree felling, stating that permissions would be granted only after compulsory afforestation efforts are completed. “We are going to ask authorities to first complete compulsory afforestation only then we will permit cutting of trees. In the number of permissions this court has granted nobody knows what happened to compulsory afforestation”, he said.

            </p>
            
            <p>The Court directed the State of UP to provide a copy of its application and the CEC's Report No. 8 of 2024 to Sr. Additional Solicitor General Garima Prashad, who is representing the State in related matters. The application is scheduled for further consideration on September 6, 2024.
